     The red chilipepper is a popular food product in New Mexico.
     What creates the heat in this pepper is the chemical <em>capsaicin</em> (C<sub>18</sub>H<sub>27</sub>NO<sub>3</sub>). 
      When eaten, natural endorphins in the body are released which not only reduce the pain from the heat
      but create a feeling of general well-being.
